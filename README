Caml-in-couch

Imagine a good nice comfy couch. Now imagine a Caml in said couch...
  If you feel a little flat, then it is time to relax.

These files constitutes a preliminary binding of CouchDB to Ocaml. It
uses several libraries for convenience, but all of these are
findlib'able and so is caml-in-couch itself. Hence, you can use the
standard findlib/OCamlMakefile bahlonga to compile it:

make
make install

TO-DO:
  Many things are still in a TO-DO-state. UTF-8 handling is miserable,
  we don't pack caml-in-couch correctly as a library etc. The most
  important thing to users, however, is:

  THE API IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE BEFORE 1.0

  I have not eaten my own dog-food and tried to use the library for
  anything yet. Hence, it may be very unwieldy in use, and that ought
  to be fixed before we freeze the API.
